## System Architecture Documentation

### Overview
The Speech4Kids application is a modular, microservice-based architecture built for scalability, maintainability, and high availability. Each microservice is responsible for a specific domain of functionality, such as ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition), TTS (Text-to-Speech), and NLP (Natural Language Processing). The system is designed to integrate seamlessly with external APIs and hardware devices, ensuring a robust and adaptive user experience.

### Core Components

#### Gateway Service
- **Purpose**: Acts as the entry point for all client interactions, handling API requests and routing them to the appropriate microservices.
- **Technology**: FastAPI, JWT Authentication, Load Balancing via NGINX.

#### ASR Service
- **Purpose**: Processes audio input to extract textual content using a hybrid Google Speech-to-Text and Wav2Vec2 pipeline.
- **Technology**: Python, PyTorch, Google Cloud APIs.

#### TTS Service
- **Purpose**: Converts text into child-friendly, expressive speech using Tacotron 2 and HiFi-GAN.
- **Technology**: Python, TensorFlow, Pre-trained TTS models.

#### NLP Service
- **Purpose**: Handles text understanding, dynamic content generation, and interaction management.
- **Technology**: OpenAI GPT-4, Hugging Face Transformers, Custom Fine-Tuned Models.
